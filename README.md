# Open Source Software for Visual Search

_Visual Search_ isn't a foreign or strange term for many users since we had _Google Reverse Image Search_ or _Google Lens_ or even _Pinterest Visual Search_. The fact is that none of those most used visual search applications are open source. So I've decided to create an open source visual search software which can be used in e-commerce.
