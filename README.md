# Open Source Software for Visual Search

_Visual Search_ isn't a foreign or strange term for many users since we had _Google Reverse Image Search_ or _Google Lens_ or even _Pinterest Visual Search_. The fact is that none of those most used visual search applications are open source. So I've decided to create an open source visual search software which can be used in e-commerce.

So let's talk more about the matter of visual search. Imagine you saw something beautiful or handy (e.g. a flower pot or a headphone) in your friend's place. You take a picture of the object but you forget to ask for details or a link to the seller's website. What should you do now? I guess you have to use a visual search engine, right? You go to a certain website, upload a picture of the product and BOOM! There's a ton of links to the sellers in front of you. Have a nice time shopping :-)

## Technologies used in this project

- __Python__: The main programming language for both AI and Backend.
- __Tensorflow__: For performing the image search.
- __Javascript/React__: For frontend (_Future plan_)
